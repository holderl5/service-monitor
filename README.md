# IS IT DOWN MONITOR ðŸ“‰
Free infrastucture monitoring that can alert you when your services go down

## Overview
Cloudflare worker to monitor and alert for downtime on a list of services.  This worker is authored in rust and uses https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs (hello world template) for the runtime.  Configuration is via a JSON object that goes in your worker's environment.

## Background
[Background info](https://www.simulakrum.com/monitoring-services-with-cloudflare-and-rust.html)

## Status
This is the initial version, there are a few TODOs left to make it complete.

## Local Testing
To make it easier to add/change the services, a shell script manipulates json files and places the data into the .dev.vars file for local testing with wrangler.

Edit config.json and resource.json
Run ./make_dev_vars.sh to overwrite .dev.vars


## Local development in docker

### Build Image
```
docker build  -t cf-rust .
```
### Run Image
```
docker run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 -v .:/home/developer/app -w /home/developer/app --name cf-rust cf-rust
```
With the --rm, the container will self delete on exit

I ran into issues running, this seemed to fix the problem, not sure how important it still is:
```
npx wrangler dev --ip 0.0.0.0
```
## Deploying to Cloudflare
Though you can add/edit environment variables directly in the cloudflare console, it is probably best that you add them to your wrangler.toml file.  I will add further information on this.

## TODOS
* Move env vars to JSON
* Move secret key to secrets
* Write more information about configuring and deployment
* Make video showing creation and deployment
